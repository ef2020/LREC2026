# Puzzle 46 — Kaytetye [SKIP]

## Reason for skipping
This puzzle focuses on kinship pronoun classification in Kaytetye. The questions (Q10.1-2) ask solvers to fill in missing pronoun forms (A-J) based on person and kinship relationship patterns. The answers involve many-to-one mappings — multiple different kinship relationships map to the same pronoun form (e.g., both gap B and gap E have the answer "elwake"). This makes it unsuitable for a clean one-to-one Match-Up table. Additionally, one gap (C) asks for a person number (2) rather than a form or translation, which doesn't fit the matching format. Q10.3 asks for a grammatical explanation, which is also not convertible.
