## Context

Yoruba is spoken by almost 30 million people in West Africa. It is written with Roman script, with some additions: accents on vowels represent tones, and e and e-dot-below represent different vowel sounds.

Here are some numbers in Yoruba:

| Yoruba | Number |
|--------|--------|
| eji | 2 |
| e-rin | 4 |
| arun | 5 |
| e-rinla | 14 |
| eejidilogun | 18 |
| eeriindilogoji | 36 |
| e-rindogoji | 44 |
| aadorin | 70 |
| eetadilogorin | 77 |
| e-tadogorin | 83 |

(Diacritics simplified for readability; see original for precise tone markings.)

## Match-Up Table

## Notes
- Items 1-5 are from Q2.1 (Yoruba to numbers).
- Items 6-10 are from Q2.2 (numbers to Yoruba).
- Diacritics (tone marks, underdots) have been simplified in this table. The original puzzle requires precise diacritics for full accuracy.
- Yoruba's counting system is based on 20s with counting back: numbers 6-9 are expressed as 4,3,2,1 before the next ten; 30,50,70,90 are expressed as 10 before the next 20.
