## Context

In our alphabet, letters stand for sounds. Japanese is different. Most Japanese words are written in characters called 'kanji', which the Japanese adapted from Chinese. Kanji characters represent meanings, not sounds. Here are some Japanese words in kanji with their English translations:

| Kanji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 日 | sun, day |
| 京 | capital (of a country) |
| 田 | rice field |
| 日本語 | Japanese language |
| 都 | city, big town |
| 英語 | English language |
| 人 | person |
| 月曜日 | Monday ('moon-day') |
| 本 | root |
| 山 | mountain |
| 金 | gold, money |
| 先生 | teacher ('before-student') |
| 東 | east |
| 日本語の先生 | Japanese language teacher |
| 中 | centre, middle |
| 外国 | foreign ('abroad-country') |

Known names: 山田 (Yamada) = mountain rice field; 本田 (Honda) = root rice field; 東京 (Tokyo) = east capital; 京都 (Kyoto) = capital city.

## Match-Up Table

| # | Kanji | Letter | English |
|---|-------|--------|---------|

| 9 | 金曜日 | i | Friday ('money day') |
| 10 | 中国 | j | China ('centre-country') |

## Notes
- Items 1-5 are from Q2 (kanji to English translation).
- Items 6-11 are from Q3 (English to kanji translation).
- Q1 asks for the meaning of well-known names (Yamada, Honda, Tokyo, Kyoto) which are already provided in the context as examples, so these are included above in the context rather than the Match-Up table.
- This puzzle involves a writing system (kanji), but the kanji characters can be represented in text and the matching structure works well for Match-Up format.
