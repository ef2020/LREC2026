## Context

The Jahai live in the Northern Malaysia peninsula near the border with Thailand. Their language has a large collection of verbs which all translate as "to smell" in English, but which describe distinctive types of smell in detail. Here are some Jahai smell verbs matched with a typical item that has the smell they describe:

| Letter | Jahai verb | Typical item |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| a | cnges | cooked food |
| b | crngir | roasted food |
| c | harim | fragrant flowers |
| d | ha' | faeces, excrement |
| e | p'us | old dwellings, mould, fungus |
| f | cnges | eye-watering smoke |
| g | p'ih | old (not fresh) blood |
| h | pl'eng | blood attractive to tigers or leopards |
| i | s'ing | human urine, village ground |

## Notes
- Items 1-6 are from Q1 (matching verbs to general smell descriptions).
- Items 7-18 are from Q2 (matching specific items to smell categories).
- This puzzle is somewhat unusual as a Match-Up because the "target language" side uses letter references to the Jahai verbs rather than the verb forms themselves, and some answers repeat. The same Jahai verb can match multiple items in Q2.
- Since multiple items map to the same Jahai verb letter, this is not a one-to-one matching puzzle in Q2. This may need a [REVIEW] tag to determine if the format is acceptable for the corpus.
