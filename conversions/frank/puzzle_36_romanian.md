## Context

Romanian is spoken by about 26 million people in Romania and Moldova, and is descended from Latin. The puzzle explores how Romanian expresses 'a' and 'the'. Note that 'a' and 'a-breve' are pronounced differently and the difference matters.

Given examples:

| Romanian | English |
|----------|---------|
| biletul | the ticket |
| un bilet | a ticket |
| baiatul | the boy |
| fata | the girl |
| o fata (with breve) | a girl |
| franzela | the bread roll |
| o franzela (with breve) | a bread roll |
| cartea | the book |
| o carte | a book |
| casa (with breve) | house |
| prieten | friend |

## Match-Up Table

| # | Romanian | Letter | English |
|---|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | un baiat | a | a boy |
| 2 | o franzela (with breve) | b | a bread roll |
| 3 | o leguma (with breve) | c | a vegetable |
| 4 | creionul | d | the pencil |
| 5 | dragostea | e | the love |
| 6 | o casa (with breve) | f | a house |
| 7 | casa | g | the house |

## Notes
- All items are fill-in-the-blank cells from the puzzle table.
- The puzzle presents a table with some cells filled and others marked with '?'. The solver must deduce the pattern of Romanian definite (suffix) and indefinite (separate word) articles.
- Romanian has two noun classes: masculine (ending in consonant, definite suffix -ul, indefinite un) and feminine (ending in -e or -a-breve, definite suffix -a, indefinite o).
- Diacritics (breve on a) are important but simplified in this table for readability.
