Source: UKLO 2016 — https://www.uklo.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2016_4.-Beijing.pdf

## Context

The Beijing subway system station names use Chinese characters with literal English translations. The puzzle provides a map showing stations with both Chinese characters and English translations of their names. Station names include combinations like: 大 (big), 石榴 (pomegranate), 庄 (village), 水 (water), 井 (well), etc.

Note: This puzzle relies heavily on a visual subway map that pairs Chinese station names with their English translations. The solver must cross-reference shared characters across station names to deduce individual character meanings.

- Chinese characters may not render correctly in all text formats; consider providing the original PDF as reference.
