## Context

In 1967, a Ghanaian engineer named Kumi Attobrah decided to create a Pan-African language with regular grammatical rules; he called his language Afrihili. Attobrah developed a series of suffixes and other alterations to change the meaning of a limited number of "basic" words. Below are some words in Afrihili with their English translations:

| Afrihili | English | Afrihili | English |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| aturesine | bouquet | ilengi | horses |
| amkate | bread | amukamo | kingdom |
| omola | child | afidi | machine |
| amola | children | omuntu | man |
| isabamatu | cobbler/shoemaker | akalini | pen |
| enti | date tree | ikalini | pens |
| amadu | dentist | ijamura | president |
| oluganda | dialect | eshuli | head teacher |
| omuntundu | dwarf | emelisini | fleet |
| ajamuri | republic | uruzi | river |
| eture | flowers | ishule | school |
| omukazi | girl | emeli | ship |
| imukazi | girls | uruzindi | stream |
| olengi | horse | adu | tooth |

## Notes
- All 10 items are from Q1.1 (filling in missing Afrihili words or English translations).
- Q1.2 asks solvers to choose from multiple-choice options and explain -- these involve reasoning rather than direct matching, so they are not included.
- Q1.3 asks for a grammatical explanation of Afrihili morphology -- skipped as not convertible.
- Key morphological patterns: plural = final vowel replaces initial vowel; head of organization = initial and final vowels reversed; professional = infix -ma-; collective = suffix -sin-; diminutive = suffix -nd-.
