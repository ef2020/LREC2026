## Context

Lithuanian is the official language of Lithuania, and is one of the surviving languages in the Baltic branch of the Indo-European family. Four Lithuanian friends -- Danute (f), Jokubas (m), Matis (m) and Regina (f) -- are planning a trip. Here are some extracts from their conversation:

| Speaker | Lithuanian | English |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Danute to Jokubas | Mes norime grazos. | We want some change. |
| Jokubas to Danute | As noriu zemelapi. | I want a map. |
| Danute to Regina | Jis skaito. | He's reading. |
| Jokubas to Matis | Ar tu turi grazos? | Do you have some change? |
| Matis to Jokubas | As neturiu grazos. | I don't have any change. |
| Matis to the others | Jus einate. | You're going. |
| Regina to the others | Mes turime grazos. | We have some change. |
| Matis to Regina | Tu turi dvirati. | You have a bike. |
| Matis to the others | Regina turi dvirati. | Regina has a bike. |
| Jokubas to Danute | Skaityk zemelapi. | Read the map! |
| Danute to Matis and Regina | Jus neskaitote zemelapi. | You aren't reading the map. |
| Matis and Regina to Danute | Mes einame. | We're going. |

(Diacritics simplified; see original for precise Lithuanian orthography.)

## Notes
- All 8 items are from the translation questions (English to Lithuanian).
- Diacritics have been simplified in this table. The original puzzle uses precise Lithuanian orthography with dots and lines above/below letters.
- The puzzle noted an error in the original: the tenth row originally contained "Tu turi zemelapi" instead of "Skaityk zemelapi", which was later corrected.
