## Reason for skipping
This puzzle involves the Braille writing system, specifically Grade 2 English Braille. The puzzle requires converting between Braille dot patterns and Roman script text. Braille characters are visual/tactile patterns of raised dots arranged in a 2x3 grid that cannot be meaningfully represented in a text-based Match-Up table. The puzzle's core challenge is about deciphering a writing system's encoding rules rather than matching translations between two languages. Additionally, the questions (7, 10-13) ask solvers to produce Braille characters, which requires drawing dot patterns -- not amenable to a text matching format.
