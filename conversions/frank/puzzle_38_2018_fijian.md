## Context

The Austronesian language Fijian is one of the official languages of Fiji. Fijian distinguishes 'inclusive us' (including you) and 'exclusive us' (excluding you), and distinguishes singular, dual (two) and plural (more than two). It also has a possessive classification system: no classifier for inalienable possession (body parts, relatives); me- for drinkables/liquids; ke- for solid edibles/patient; no- for general possessions/ownership.

## Notes
- All 13 items are from Q4.1 (English to Fijian translation of possessive phrases).
- Q4.2 asks for the three different ways to say 'my coconut' (na mequ niu, na kequ niu, na noqu niu) and their distinct meanings. This is a three-way distinction with explanation, which does not fit the standard Match-Up two-column format well, so it is not included.
