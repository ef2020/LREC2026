## Reason for skipping
This puzzle is about the Inuktitut syllabic writing system, where each character represents a consonant-vowel syllable. The puzzle requires solvers to:
1. Deduce which Inuktitut syllabic characters correspond to which sounds
2. Write names in Inuktitut syllabic script (items 4-6)
3. Determine when a name cannot be written (items 7-11: "No O", "No D", "No J or E")

The core challenge is a writing system decipherment, and the answers involve producing syllabic characters (visual symbols) or stating impossibility. This cannot be meaningfully converted to a text-based Match-Up format because:
- The Inuktitut syllabic characters, while representable in Unicode, form the substance of the puzzle rather than being a medium for linguistic matching
- Several answers are "impossible" explanations rather than translation pairs
- The three-column structure (writing, sounds, meaning) does not reduce to a two-column Match-Up
