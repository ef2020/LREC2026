## Notes
- Items 1-5 are from Q8.1 (English to Choctaw, sentences 13-17).
- Items 6-10 are from Q8.2 (Choctaw to English, sentences 28-32).
- Items 6 and 7 both translate to "Your leg is cut" but differ in Choctaw: item 6 (Chiyyit chibashah) uses the second-person possessive prefix on both the noun and the adjective, while item 7 (Chiyyit bashah) uses it only on the noun. Both are accepted translations per the solution key.
- Choctaw uses pronoun affixes rather than separate pronoun words, with three sets (A, B, C) used in different grammatical contexts: Set A for verb subjects, Set B for direct objects/adjective subjects/inalienable possession, Set C for indirect objects/alienable possession.
