## Context

Swedish is a Germanic language, related to English. One of the differences between the two languages is that in Swedish, adjectives decline (change form) based on grammatical gender and function in the sentence. Here are some sentences and their translations that demonstrate this phenomenon.

- Converted from Q 1.1 which has 5 fill-in-the-gap sentences (a)-(e) requiring Swedish adjective forms.
- Q 1.2a (which adjective behaves differently) and Q 1.2b (related English adjective) are skipped as they require grammatical explanation rather than matching.
