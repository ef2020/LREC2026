# Puzzle 22 — Norwedish

## Context

Norwegian and Swedish are said to be so closely related that speakers of one can understand the other -- they are mutually comprehensible. Like English, German and Dutch, the languages are classified as 'Germanic'.

Below are some sentences in both languages with their English translations. Note: the accents matter as "a" is different from "a-umlaut" or "a-ring."

Key differences: Norwegian negation "ikke" vs. Swedish "inte"; Norwegian demonstrative "dette" vs. Swedish "det har"; Norwegian language names end in -sk, Swedish in -ska (except "norsk" is the same in both).
