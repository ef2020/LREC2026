## Context

Norwegian and Swedish are said to be so closely related that speakers of one can understand the other -- they are mutually comprehensible. Like English, German and Dutch, the languages are classified as 'Germanic'.

Below are some sentences in both languages with their English translations. Note: the accents matter as "a" is different from "a-umlaut" or "a-ring."

| Norwegian | Swedish | English |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Kan du snakke litt langsommere? | Kan du tala lite langsammere? | Can you speak a little more slowly? |
| Jeg forstar ikke. | Jag forstar inte. | I don't understand. |
| Snakker du norsk? | Talar du svenska? | Do you speak Norwegian/Swedish? |
| Vi liker engelsk. | Vi gillar engelska. | We like English. |
| Han spiser middag. | Han ater middag. | He is eating dinner. |
| Nar gar neste tog? | Nar gar naste tag? | When does (the) next train go? |
| Hun liker frokost. | Hon gillar frukost. | She likes breakfast. |
| Dette er ikke Storbritannia. | Det har ar inte Storbritannien. | This is not Great Britain. |

Key differences: Norwegian negation "ikke" vs. Swedish "inte"; Norwegian demonstrative "dette" vs. Swedish "det har"; Norwegian language names end in -sk, Swedish in -ska (except "norsk" is the same in both).

## Notes
- Converted from Q 3.1 (10 sentences, identify Norwegian or Swedish, items 1-10) and Q 3.2 (6 English sentences, translate into both Norwegian and Swedish, items 11-22).
- Q 3.1 is a language-identification task converted to Match-Up by pairing each sentence with its language label.
- Q 3.2 produces paired translations: each English sentence yields one Norwegian and one Swedish version.
- The Match-Up table is large (22 items) because both question types are combined.
