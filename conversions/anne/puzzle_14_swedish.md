## Context

Swedish is a Germanic language, related to English. One of the differences between the two languages is that in Swedish, adjectives decline (change form) based on grammatical gender and function in the sentence. Here are some sentences and their translations that demonstrate this phenomenon.

| # | Swedish | English |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | Den fina grisen ar stor. | The pretty pig is big. |
| 2 | Det stora huset ar fult. | The big house is ugly. |
| 3 | Den grona bilen ar ful. | The green car is ugly. |
| 4 | Det grona applet ar stort. | The green apple is big. |
| 5 | Den konstiga hunden ar liten. | The weird dog is small. |
| 6 | Det bruna applet ar litet. | The brown apple is small. |
| 7 | Den stora skogen ar gron. | The big forest is green. |
| 8 | Det trasiga taket ar smutsigt. | The broken roof is dirty. |
| 9 | Den lilla katten ar fin. | The small cat is pretty. |
| 10 | Den gula grenen ar smutsig. | The yellow branch is dirty. |
| 11 | Det langa huset ar brunt. | The long house is brown. |

## Notes
- Converted from Q 1.1 which has 5 fill-in-the-gap sentences (a)-(e) requiring Swedish adjective forms.
- Q 1.2a (which adjective behaves differently) and Q 1.2b (related English adjective) are skipped as they require grammatical explanation rather than matching.
