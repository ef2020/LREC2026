## Reason for skipping
This puzzle is a phonology and writing system puzzle (tagged "Ph,Wr") that requires converting between Komnzo orthography and phonetic transcription (IPA). The tasks are:

1. Q 4.1: Write phonetic transcriptions in the new orthography (3 items).
2. Q 4.2: Write orthographic forms in phonetic transcription with syllable boundaries (8 items).
3. Q 4.3: Explain the phonological rules.

This cannot be meaningfully converted to Match-Up format because:
- The puzzle is about applying phonological rules (epenthesis, allophony, syllabification) to transform representations between two notation systems.
- While Q4.1 and Q4.2 could technically be presented as matching pairs (orthography to transcription), this would be trivial pattern-matching rather than the intended phonological analysis -- the solver would just match character sequences without understanding the rules.
- Q4.3 requires a grammatical/phonological explanation.
- The puzzle is fundamentally about the writing system and phonotactics, not about meaning-based matching.
