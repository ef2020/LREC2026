## Reason for skipping
This puzzle is a writing system puzzle (tagged "Wr") about the Ditema tsa Dinoko script, a recently invented geometric writing system for Bantu languages of southern Africa. The tasks are:

1. Q 4.1: Convert three words written in Ditema tsa Dinoko geometric symbols into Roman script.
2. Q 4.2: Identify which of four geometric symbol sequences represents "Ditema tsa Dinoko."

This cannot be meaningfully converted to Match-Up format because:
- The entire puzzle depends on visual recognition and decoding of geometric symbols (triangles, arrows, and other shapes with specific orientations that encode vowels and consonants).
- The context data pairs geometric symbol images with their Roman script equivalents -- these images cannot be represented in text.
- Removing the visual geometric symbols would eliminate the core challenge.
- The puzzle is fundamentally about a visual writing system, not about linguistic meaning-based matching.
