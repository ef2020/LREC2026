Note that the kola nut is the seed of the cola tree, traditionally chewed for its stimulating effects. Yam is a long edible tuber, similar in appearance to a sweet potato. gb, kp, ny and glottal stop are consonants; open-e and open-o are vowels. The symbol tilde over a vowel indicates nasalisation. Khana also has a tonal system, but for simplicity this has not been marked.
