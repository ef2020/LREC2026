## Context

Yawalapiti is an Arawakan language spoken by the Yawalapiti people in Xingu Park in Brazil. It only has three remaining fluent speakers.

Below are some words in Yawalapiti with their English translations. Note that special phonetic characters are used for certain sounds.

| Yawalapiti | English |
|------------|---------|
| itsapaka | your (pl) cheek |
| ikuʂu | his head |
| aputaka kuma | our city |
| awɨujatsi | our pond |
| ipina | his house / your (pl) house |
| imotola | his motor |
| inamikula | his friend |
| itʃuʂu | your (pl) head |
| numunujati | my forehead |
| awita | our bow |
| pamikula | your (sg) friend |
| nupinatsi | my hut |
| hitʃapulu kuma | your (sg) gorilla |
| itsipa kuma | your (pl) mountain |

| hitsipulu | your (sg) knee |
| itapaka | his cheek |
| hirutakatsi | your (sg) village |
| akapulu | our spider monkey |
| hitsipatsi | your (sg) pebble |

Possessive prefixes vary before consonants and vowels. The suffix -tsi is diminutive, and kuma creates a grander meaning. Root-initial consonants palatalise after 2nd person prefixes: p>r, t>ts, k>tʃ, m>ɲ (though not fully regular).

## Notes
- Converted from Q 1.2 (match 6 Yawalapiti words to English, items 1-6), Q 1.3 (translate 6 words, items 7-12), and Q 1.4 (produce 8 Yawalapiti words, items 13-20). All 20 items combined.
- Q 1.1 (which meaning of ipina is surprising and what was expected) is skipped as it requires grammatical explanation.
- For Q 1.3 items 7, 8, 11: the linguist was "surprised" by certain forms -- the expected forms were awukula, hirina, and hiɲotola respectively. The actual translations are used in the table.
