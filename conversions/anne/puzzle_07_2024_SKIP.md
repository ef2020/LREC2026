## Reason for skipping
This puzzle is a writing system puzzle (tagged "Sy,Wr") that requires visual recognition of Khmer script characters. The core task involves identifying dish names written in Khmer script and matching them to English translations based on recognizing recurring Khmer character sequences. The puzzle cannot be meaningfully converted to a text-based Match-Up format because:

1. The Khmer script is the essential element -- solvers must visually parse and compare script characters to identify ingredients.
2. Questions Q3.1 and Q3.4 present new dishes entirely in Khmer script that must be decoded.
3. A transliteration-based version would remove the fundamental challenge of the puzzle.
4. Q3.2 and Q3.3 require inferring word meanings, not matching pairs.
