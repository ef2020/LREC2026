## Reason for skipping
[REVIEW] The source file for this puzzle is a .zip archive that could not be extracted (the downloaded file appears to be an HTML redirect page rather than a valid zip archive). The puzzle text is unavailable for conversion. This puzzle needs to be obtained directly from the UKLO website or from the shared Google Drive. Once the content is available, it should be reassessed for convertibility. Tags indicate "Se,Mo" (semantics, morphology), which would typically be convertible.
