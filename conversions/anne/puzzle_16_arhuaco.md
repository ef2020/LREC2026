- Converted from Q 5.1 (items a-f, translate into Arhuaco with given nouns), Q 5.2 (items a-c, provide correct verb for scenarios), and Q 5.3 (items a-c, translate hat scenarios into Arhuaco). All 12 items combined.
- Items 7-9 from Q 5.2 provide only the verb form, not full sentences, since Q 5.2 asks only for the verb.
