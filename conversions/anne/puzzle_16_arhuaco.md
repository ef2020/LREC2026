## Context

Arhuaco is a language spoken by the Arhuaco people in Northern Colombia, with about 8,000 speakers (90% monolingual). The language is also known as Ica and Bintuk.

Arhuaco has different verbs for expressing putting objects in a particular place or position. The shape of the object and the position also matter for the type of verb used.

Shape classifications:
- Flat objects (book, plate, poster): pan / kᴧpas / ipan
- Long objects (stick, machete, sword, needle, pencil): gaka / kᴧgaka / igeika
- 3D objects (rock, house, hat, sack of corn): sa / kᴧsa / isa
- Upright position: tšoɁs / kᴧtšoɁs / itšo

## Notes
- Context and Match-Up tables have been combined into a single Match-Up table with 25 items (items 1–13 from the original context, items 14–25 from the original match-up questions).
- Converted from Q 5.1 (items a-f, translate into Arhuaco with given nouns), Q 5.2 (items a-c, provide correct verb for scenarios), and Q 5.3 (items a-c, translate hat scenarios into Arhuaco). Context pairs form items 1–13.
- Items 20-22 from Q 5.2 provide only the verb form, not full sentences, since Q 5.2 asks only for the verb.
