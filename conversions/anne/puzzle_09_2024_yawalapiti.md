## Context

Yawalapiti is an Arawakan language spoken by the Yawalapiti people in Xingu Park in Brazil. It only has three remaining fluent speakers.

Below are some words in Yawalapiti with their English translations. Note that special phonetic characters are used for certain sounds.

Possessive prefixes vary before consonants and vowels. The suffix -tsi is diminutive, and kuma creates a grander meaning. Root-initial consonants palatalise after 2nd person prefixes: p>r, t>ts, k>tʃ, m>ɲ (though not fully regular).

## Notes
- Context and Match-Up tables have been combined into a single Match-Up table with 40 items (items 1–20 from the original context, items 21–40 from the original match-up questions).
- Converted from Q 1.2 (match 6 Yawalapiti words to English, items 21–26), Q 1.3 (translate 6 words, items 27–32), and Q 1.4 (produce 8 Yawalapiti words, items 33–40). Context pairs form items 1–20.
- Q 1.1 (which meaning of ipina is surprising and what was expected) is skipped as it requires grammatical explanation.
- For Q 1.3 items 27, 28, 31: the linguist was "surprised" by certain forms -- the expected forms were awukula, hirina, and hiɲotola respectively. The actual translations are used in the table.
