# Puzzle 15 — Buhid [SKIP]

## Reason for skipping
This puzzle is a writing system puzzle (tagged "Wr") that requires decoding the Buhid script, an abugida writing system used by the Mangyan people of the Philippines. The tasks are:

1. Q 2.1: Complete missing words in a transliteration by reading Buhid script characters (8 gaps).
2. Q 2.2: Write "abugida" in the Buhid script.

This cannot be meaningfully converted to Match-Up format because:
- The entire puzzle depends on visual recognition and decoding of Buhid script glyphs.
- The data (a Buhid song) is presented in the Buhid script with partial Roman transliteration, and the solver must decode the script to fill in the missing transliterations.
- Removing the Buhid script images would eliminate the core challenge of the puzzle.
- A text-only representation cannot capture the visual glyph-matching required.
