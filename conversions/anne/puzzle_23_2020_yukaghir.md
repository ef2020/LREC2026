## Notes
- Context sentences (items 1-12) and match-up items (items 13-22) have been combined into a single Match-Up table.
- Items 13-16 are from Q9.1 (Yukaghir to English translation).
- Items 17-22 are from Q9.2 (English to Yukaghir translation).
- Note on item 16: the solution notes that sentence 1d is technically incorrect as it combines pronoun 'he' with the verb form for 'we', so "We/He will not come with a bag" is also accepted.
