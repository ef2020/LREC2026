| -sika | the speaker uses what they already know (e.g. habitual knowledge) |
| -pidaka | the speaker was told by a third party |

## Notes
- Context and Match-Up tables have been combined into a single Match-Up table with 25 items (items 1–16 from the three narrative context tables, items 17–25 from the original match-up questions).
- The Ending|Meaning and Person|Prefix|Pronoun tables are kept as context reference information and not included in the combined table.
- The English descriptions include speaker and evidence context to make each pairing unique and unambiguous, since multiple statements share the same surface English translation but differ in evidentiality marking.
- Converted from Q 5.1 (gaps a and b), Q 5.2 (gap c), and Q 5.3 (gaps d-i). Narrative context pairs form items 1–16.
