## Context

Paiwan is a minority language in Taiwan/Republic of China, spoken by around 66,000 native speakers in the southern region of the island. One of the major components of Paiwan syntax is "focus", which applies to the new piece of information that the sentence is conveying. Sentence elements in italics are focused. The digraph dj represents a single sound.
