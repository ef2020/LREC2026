Source: UKLO 2021 — https://www.uklo.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2021_6-Longgu.pdf

## Context

Longgu is spoken by about 3,000 people in parts of the island of Guadalcanal, one of the Solomon Islands. Longgu has a more complex pronoun system than English, distinguishing between dual (2 people), paucal (a few), and plural (many). For first person, there is also a distinction between inclusive (including the addressee) and exclusive (not including the addressee).

Data from imaginary conversations involving four famous Solomon Islands sports stars: Jenly (weightlifter, female), Pauline (runner, female), Francis (male soccer player), and Commins (male soccer player).

Pronoun paradigm:

| Person | Dual (2) | Paucal (a few) | Plural (many) |
|--------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| 1st inclusive | gaoa | golu | gia |
| 1st exclusive | amerua | amelu | ami |
| 2nd person | amurua | amolu | amu |
| 3rd person | girua | giraolu | gira |
