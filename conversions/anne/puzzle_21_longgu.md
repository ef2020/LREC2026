## Context

Longgu is spoken by about 3,000 people in parts of the island of Guadalcanal, one of the Solomon Islands. Longgu has a more complex pronoun system than English, distinguishing between dual (2 people), paucal (a few), and plural (many). For first person, there is also a distinction between inclusive (including the addressee) and exclusive (not including the addressee).

Data from imaginary conversations involving four famous Solomon Islands sports stars: Jenly (weightlifter, female), Pauline (runner, female), Francis (male soccer player), and Commins (male soccer player).

## Notes
- Converted from Q 6 which has 11 situations requiring the correct Longgu pronoun. Each situation is paired with the correct pronoun.
- Items 1-5 required choosing from {amolu, amu, amurua} or {girua, giraolu, gira}. Items 6-11 required producing the pronoun independently.
- Note that items 2 and 4 have the same answer (amolu) since both involve addressing a paucal group as "you."
