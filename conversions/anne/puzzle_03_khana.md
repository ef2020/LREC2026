## Context

Khana is an Atlantic-Congo language spoken by the Ogoni people of Rivers State, Nigeria. It has around 450,000 native speakers. Below are some sentences in Khana with their English translations.

Note that the kola nut is the seed of the cola tree, traditionally chewed for its stimulating effects. Yam is a long edible tuber, similar in appearance to a sweet potato. gb, kp, ny and glottal stop are consonants; open-e and open-o are vowels. The symbol tilde over a vowel indicates nasalisation. Khana also has a tonal system, but for simplicity this has not been marked.

## Notes
- Converted from Q 4.2 (sentences 13-16, translate Khana to English) and Q 4.3 (sentences 17-20, translate English to Khana). All 8 items are combined into a single Match-Up table.
- Q 4.1 (explaining inalienable possession) is skipped as it requires a grammatical explanation rather than a translation.
