## Context

Filomeno Mata Totonac (FMT) is a variety of the Totonac language family spoken in Mexico. FMT has ideophones -- words that evoke a sensory image and often come in series of different intensities.

There are three consonant series: S = {s, sh, lateral-fricative}, T = {ts, tsh, tl}, K = {k, q}. There are also three vowel sets: A = {a}, I = {i, e}, U = {u, o}.

Ideophones fall into categories:
- "Colours" have a specific consonant-vowel pattern; moving the first consonant up the series makes the colour paler.
- "Shapes" have a repeating pattern.
- "Sounds/motions" are one word repeated.
- "Odours/flavours" can have any form but must contain consonants from S, T, or K.

Below are some known ideophones and their sensory descriptions:

## Notes
- Converted from Q 10.1 which provides 13 ideophone words to be matched to 13 gap descriptions (a)-(m). This is inherently a matching task.
- Q 10.2 (which word is not a real ideophone), Q 10.3 (suggest translations), Q 10.4 and Q 10.5 (identify sensory properties) are skipped as they require explanatory/inferential answers rather than matching.
