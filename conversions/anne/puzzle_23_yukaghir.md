## Notes
- Items 1-4 are from Q9.1 (Yukaghir to English translation).
- Items 5-10 are from Q9.2 (English to Yukaghir translation).
- Note on item 4: the solution notes that sentence 1d is technically incorrect as it combines pronoun 'he' with the verb form for 'we', so "We/He will not come with a bag" is also accepted.
