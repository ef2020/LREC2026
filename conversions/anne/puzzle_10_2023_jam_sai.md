## Notes
- The context and match-up tables have been combined into a single Match-Up table with 33 items (24 from context, 9 from the original match-up).
- Items 1–24 are from the original context table: each base verb and its derived form are listed as separate entries.
- Items 25–33 are from the original match-up (Q 2.1), which requires deriving 9 Jam Sai verb forms from the given base verbs using the causative or reversative pattern.
- The puzzle is self-contained: the context provides the derivation patterns, and the Match-Up tests whether the solver can apply them correctly.
