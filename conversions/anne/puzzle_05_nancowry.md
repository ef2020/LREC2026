## Notes
- Context word pairs (items 1-37) and match-up items (items 38-54) have been combined into a single Match-Up table.
- Converted from Q 1.1 which has 17 fill-in-the-gap items (a)-(q). Each gap requires either a Nancowry word or an English translation. All are paired in the Match-Up table.
- In gap (m), one letter cannot be deduced from the data, represented as X (the answer is kXtal, where X is unknown).
- Q 1.2 (matching 4 Nancowry words to English translations) could also be converted but is already a matching task with only 4 items. It has been omitted to avoid overlap, but could be appended if desired: 1-kahay=to feel empty in the heart, 2-kumfec=to make something tiny, 3-mahelepa=a thing that is made to fit, 4-tanian=a file (tool).
