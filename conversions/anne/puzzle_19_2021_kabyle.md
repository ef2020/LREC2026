Here are some sentences in Kabyle and their English translations.

Key patterns:
- Word order: Verb-Subject
- Verb affixes: -egh (I), -ent (they, feminine), ye- (he), te- (she/feminine)

## Notes
- Context (8 sentence pairs) and Match-Up (4 items) combined into a single Match-Up table of 12 items.
- Converted from Q 2.1 (sentences 9-12, translate English to Kabyle). All 4 items combined.
- Q 2.2 (multiple choice about why "Yuzzel teqcict" is incorrect) is skipped as it requires selecting and justifying a grammatical rule rather than matching. The answer is "A verb has the prefix t- if its subject is feminine" -- the verb should come last (VSO word order, so feminine subject requires t- on verb, making the correct form Tuzzel teqcict).
