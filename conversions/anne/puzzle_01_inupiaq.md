## Context

Most languages, including both English and Inupiaq, have processes that allow speakers to create new words from old words, with different but related meanings. Below are some sets of Inupiaq words, each with one or more English translations. The words in these groups are all related to each other by derivational suffixes.

Key suffixes (deducible from data):
- N-pak = large N
- N-uraq = small N
- N-lik = thing that has N / thing characterised by N
- N-un = tool for N
- N-iyaun = tool that removes N
- N-piaq = real N, Inupiaq N
- N-nngguaq = fake/artificial N
- N-taq = product of N

Before suffixes other than -pak and -taq, the final consonant is dropped.

## Notes
- Context word pairs (items 1-36) and match-up items (items 37-48) have been combined into a single Match-Up table.
- Converted from Q 2.1 which has 12 fill-in-the-gap items (a)-(l). Six gaps require English translations and six require Inupiaq words. All 12 are combined into a single Match-Up table pairing Inupiaq words with English meanings.
- Q 2.2 (literal translation of killalik), Q 2.3 (Inupiaq word for "little devil"), Q 2.4 (type of footwear), and Q 2.5 (distinguishing two oil types) are skipped as they require open-ended/explanatory answers rather than simple matching.
