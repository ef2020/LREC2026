# LREC2026 — Rosetta Stone to Match-Up Puzzle Corpus

This repository supports the preparation of a camera-ready paper and companion corpus for **LREC 2026** (Language Resources and Evaluation Conference).

## About

The project presents a systematic method for converting **Rosetta Stone** linguistics olympiad puzzles into **Match-Up** format puzzles. The resulting corpus pairs each original Rosetta Stone puzzle with its Match-Up equivalent, creating a new resource for computational linguistics and NLP research.

## Status

- **Paper**: Accepted at LREC 2026. Camera-ready due **March 6, 2026**.
- **Corpus**: 31 of 97 puzzles converted. Remaining 66 in progress (due **Feb 27, 2026**).
