2026 – Round 1
Problem 3. Lezgian (20 marks)
Lezgian is a Nakh-Daghestani language spoken by the Lezgin peo-
ple in southwestern Russia and northeastern Azerbaijan, with about
630,000 speakers as of 2020.
Below are some Lezgian nouns given in two forms, along with
their English translations. The absolutive form is used for the subject
of an intransitive verb or object of a transitive verb, and the ergative
form is used for the subject of a transitive verb, but this is not
relevant to the solution of the problem. Some absolutive forms are
not given, but they do exist.
Note that crimson is a colour. ü is a vowel pronounced like i but with rounded lips; c', č, č', ǧ, k',
q', š, and ž are consonants.

Maximum 40 pts.
Q 3.1 Max 40. 2 pts each if correct; 1 pt with one mistake. A mistake is any of an extra/missing/incorrect
letter (including diacritics). Swapping the order of two letters is not a single mistake. All let-
ter+diacritic combinations (e.g. c', č, č') should be counted a single letter.
E.g. for t., šekerdi scores 2 pts. Any of sekerdi, qekerdi, šakerdi, šekerd, šekerdit all score 1
pt. šekredi scores 0 pts, since there are two mistakes.

• (j) is added after a vowel.
• After back vowels a and u: A = a.
After front vowels e, i, and ü: A = e.
Note: Stress usually falls at some lexically determined position, typically the second syllable.
The reason that A exhibits vowel harmony is that it attracts stress and there is vowel harmony
until the stressed syllable.
