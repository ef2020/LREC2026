2026 – Round 1
Problem 4. Khana (25 marks)
Khana is an Atlantic-Congo language spoken by the Ogoni people of
Rivers State, Nigeria (pictured in red).
It has around 450,000 native
speakers, but it is also considered the prestige variety of the Ogoni lan-
guages, so has many second-language speakers.
Below are some sentences in Khana with their English translations.
Note that the kola nut is the seed of the cola tree, traditionally chewed for
its stimulating effects. Yam is a long edible tuber, similar in appearance
to a sweet potato. gb, kp, ɲ and ʔ are consonants; ɛ and ɔ are vowels.
The symbol ◌̃ over a vowel indicates that it is pronounced with airflow through the nose. Khana also
has a tonal system, but for simplicity this has not been marked.

Pia gbo de na ɛrɛta apɛɛ zĩã.
The dogs eat my eight slices of yam.

Problem 4. Khana Answers
4.1
The heart is a body part.
4.2
13. Their wives + drop just + my kola nuts.
14. Ten fathers + want five + logs to sell.
15. His arms + have four + splashes of water.
16. Seven mothers + kill just my + one snake.
4.3
17. Aninia apɛɛ + mĩã + ɔb + [na] baɛ akpo + tɔ mɛ.
18. Pia + mũnũ wa + ɛrɛ + iniʔĩ ãpɛɛ + bũũãyib.
19. Ye taa + ka gbo [ye] + gbĩ + na ɛrɛta bee + zooade [mɛ].
20. Pia + dɛ̃ɛ̃ ye + muɛ aba + zĩĩ bee + kɛ̃.
Maximum 35 pts.
Q 4.1 Max 3. Award 3 pts for any correct statement that the heart is a body part, and therefore uses
X mɛ rather than na X. E.g. “A heart is a part of you”; “mɛ is used for inalienable possession”,
etc, all score 3 pts. Do not require an explanation of why that affects word choice or word
order. Do not award e.g. “ɲiɛ must come first” without explanation of why.
Q 4.2 Max 12. Split each response into three regions as closely as possible to the official solution. A
region may be empty. For each region, award 1 pt if it is correct.
Do not penalise incorrect English tense. Do not penalise minor grammatical mistakes or varia-
tions in the English, e.g. just drops or drops just for drop just, or to sell five logs, unless they impact
the meaning. Do require kola nuts in 13, not just kola, since this relates to the choice of Khana
classifier.
Q 4.3 Max 20. Split each sentence into five regions as closely as possible to the official solution. A
region may be empty. For each region, award 1 pt if correct. Split the sentences however allows
you to award the most points. Where a word is given in [square brackets], award the point for
the region whether it is present or not.
Do not penalise clear copying errors within roots, e.g. anina for aninia. Note however that
nasalisation (a vs ã) is significant, so should not be treated as a copying error.
E.g. Taa ka gbo ye gbi na ɛrɛta zooade. score 0+1+0+0+1 = 2/5 for 20.
