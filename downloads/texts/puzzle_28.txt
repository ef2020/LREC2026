Problem 2. Japanese characters (5 marks) 
In our alphabet, letters stand for sounds. Japanese is different. Most Japanese 
words are written in characters called ‘kanji’, which the Japanese adapted 
from Chinese. Kanji characters represent meanings, not sounds. For example, 
火 means ‘fire’ and is generally pronounced hi. In borrowings from Chinese, 
however, it is pronounced ka: ‘Tuesday’, for instance, is 火曜日ka-you-bi (‘fire day’, after the 
Chinese philosophy of the Five Elements). Here are some more Japanese words in kanji with their 
English translations (and literal translations in quotation marks in brackets). You may like to know 
that each kanji has just one form, without anything like our distinction between capital (‘upper case’) 
and small (‘lower case’) letters.

sun, day 
京 
capital (of a country) 
田

Commentary 
All characters represent meaning, but sometimes what is one word in English is represented by two 
characters in Japanese:先生‘teacher’ (sen-sei), 曜日‘day [of the week]’.  
• 
The kanji for ‘Japan’ is 日本‘sun-root’ (ni-hon) . This is normally more poetically translated as 
‘Land of the Rising Sun’.  
• 
Japanese word order is often the reverse of English. For example, 日本語の先生literally 
reads in English: ‘Japan-language-of-teacher’ (ni-hon-go-no-sen-sei). 
• 
As well as kanji, Japanese also employs two syllabic scripts, to write foreign words and the 
grammatical endings of verbs, adjectives, etc. To read in Japanese, it is thought that you 
need to know about 2,000 characters—most of which have two different meanings and two 
different pronunciations.  
• 
の, used in the problem, is not kanji but belongs to one of the syllabic scripts. It is a 
grammatical particle similar to the English possessive ’s or the preposition of.  
• 
There is some advantage in having a script that is not connected to a language’s sounds in 
the way that the alphabet is. It makes reading and writing much easier for people with 
dyslexia (where there is often a problem in linking sounds to letter symbols).  
• 
Japanese can be written horizontally, as in this puzzle, in which case it is written from left to 
right. Often, however, Japanese is written from top to bottom, in which case, the columns 
go from right to left.
