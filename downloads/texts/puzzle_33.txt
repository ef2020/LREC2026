Problem 10. Going dotty about Braille =  g+ dotty ab,braille 
(25 marks) 
Braille is a tactile writing system, consisting of raised dots, used by visually impaired people. A 
Braille character consists of a combination of raised dots arranged in two columns of three 
rows, as in the example on the right (where the lighter dots are mere place holders for 
potential raised dots).  
While it is possible to write a Braille character for every letter and punctuation sign, this makes Braille texts 
cumbersomely large and slow to read. Braille users have designed an advanced Braille code (called ‘Grade 2’) 
for individual languages to  create shorter forms. Grade 2 Braille codes usually have one Braille symbol 
substituting for two or more letters, often showing combinations that are very frequent in that particular 
language (for example, Spanish Grade 2 Braille has one symbol to stand in for “ll”, which is a common letter 
combination in Spanish). The title of the problem is written in Grade 2 English Braille, as are all the Braille 
texts below. 
Moreover, because only 62 distinct Braille symbols are possible, most symbols are “recycled” and can be 
used to represent mathematical symbols or musical notation if needed. Usually, if a text changes from 
Braille-as-letters to Braille-as-mathematical symbols, this is indicated, so that a Braille reader knows how to 
read the symbols.  
Below are some more examples of Roman-Braille pairs, as well as some where one of the pair is missing. The 
challenge for you is to use your answer sheet to fill in the blanks 5 and 7-13 as required, including 
punctuation signs. For Braille transcriptions,  
• 
write them from left to write using one box per Braille character and as many rows as necessary. 
• 
leave a blank box between words. 
• 
let each cell define the two columns and three rows; for example, to write a single dot in the first 
row and first column you write it in the top left corner of the cell. The markers will not accept 
unclear or ambiguous dots.

Solution and marking. 
Scoring   (max 114) 
• 
5: 1 point for each correct word. No half marks. (max 5) 
• 
7: 1 for each correct Braille character, plus 1 for all correct empty cells in between. (max 17) 
o Score only 1 for a string that could have been replaced by a single character, e.g. <ea>, 
<people>. The answers given here are the minimum, but expanded versions are also 
possible. 
o No extra penalties for omitted letters. 
o The alphabetical correspondences shown below the Braille character are just to help you, 
and not expected from the competitors.
