Commentary 
This problem is about the syntax and morphology of a typical Bantu language, in which prefixes distinguish 
singular and plural nouns, and are repeated on words to which they are related, including verbs. But there are 
some extra twists to the story. In the following N, S and P stand for prefixes which are explained below. 
 N (‘number’) distinguishes singular and plural: 
o N is generally mu for the singular and ba for the plural, but 
o before words beginning with n/m + consonant, which also happen to be animal 
names, mu disappears (e.g. mbwa, ntambe). 
 S (‘small’) means ‘small’: 
o S is ka (singular) or tu (plural). 
o S stands before N (e.g. kamuntu) 
 P (‘prefix’) is the prefix which is repeated on the verb and ‘the’ (see below). 
o P is the noun’s first prefix, so if there is an S, S = P; otherwise N = P. 
 Subjects and objects are treated differently: 
o Between the subject and the verb there is a word whose function and meaning are 
unclear (‘the’? ‘past tense’?): P + vwa. 
o The subject stands before the verb while the object follows it. 
o The verb has the P of its subject but not of its object.
