Problem 2. Buhid Script (5 marks) 
Buhid is spoken by the Mangyan people on the island of 
Mindoro in the Philippines. In 2009 there were about 
9,300 Buhid speakers. Buhid is also known as Mangyan. 
It is written in the Buhid script, which is descended 
from Southern Indian scripts which spread east via the 
Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, and Bali. 
In the table below left is the text of a Buhid song, with some of it transliterated into the Roman alphabet. 
However some of the transliteration is missing: each number refers to a complete word in Buhid, and each 
underscore _ indicates where there is a letter missing.  
Q 2.1 Complete the missing words of the transliteration.

Solution and marking. 
Scoring: (max 20) 
• Q2.1: 1 point per 'slot' (i.e. syllables separated by +) 
 
[max 16] 
o expect the specified number of slots, so extra syllables have to be squeezed into one of 
these slots and therefore create an error; e.g. for ka+hu, baka+hu = 0 + 1. 
• Q2.2: 1 point per glyph/character  
 
 
 
 
[max 4] 
o ignore extra characters. 
Q 2.1 Complete the missing words of the transliteration.  
1. ka+hu              2 
5. sa                     1 
2. ka+bu+ya        3 
6. sa                     1 
3. ka+du+ya        3

Commentary 
Translation of the text: (for information only, not needed for solving the puzzle). 
“like a tree with overgrown branches 
my mind is full of turmoil 
though loaded with pain and grief 
my dreams continually seek for an end 
let it be known that I am on my way 
perchance you’ll catch up with me.” 
 
Buhid is a syllabic script (abugida), which means its consonant characters automatically contain the vowel 
sound ‘a’. The list of consonant-vowel pairs pasted below comes from the Wikipedia article on this script. 
Where the vowels, a, i, and u occur independently, there is an independent vowel character, but 
otherwise, vowels are indicated  with the characters of the consonants. A character without a diacritic 
mark has an inherent ‘a’, a character with a short horizontal line at the top right of it, means the inherent 
vowel is ‘i’ and a short horizontal line at the bottom right of the character means the inherent vowel is ‘u’. 
For example, when writing in Buhid script, there is no spacing between words:
