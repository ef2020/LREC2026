Comment 
This problem is intended as an introduction to Chinese characters, because competitors are forced to pay close 
attention to their internal structure in order to distinguish them from one another. The grammar is easy because the 
characters follow the same order within each name as the words in the English translations.  
It’s easy to get started. For instance, the two English names in the bottom left of the map both share big: Big tile pit 
and Big well. Their Chinese names also share a character, so this must mean ‘big’. And so on.
