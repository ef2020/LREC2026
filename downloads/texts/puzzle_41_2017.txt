Problem 2. Inuit writing (5 marks) 
Inuktitut is a language spoken by the Inuit people in the north of Canada which has an interesting writing system that 
was invented by missionaries in the nineteenth century. As you will see from the examples, each character tends to 
stand for a syllable rather than for a single consonant or vowel sound.   
 
The table shows some names, including some Inuit mythical creatures, and a few familiar words that we have 
borrowed. Your task is to fill the empty cells. (A cell with a line through it counts as full.) If this is impossible, give a 
brief explanation (e.g. ‘No X’, if it’s impossible because you need an X and there isn’t one). ‘q’ is a k-like sound that 
we don’t use.

Solution and marking. 
Scoring:  max 25 
 
#1-3: 2 points for each correct cell. 1 for half right (e.g. …at, Lu…) 
 
#4-10: 1 point for each correct character or explanation (e.g. ‘no O’).  
o Some characters are compounds, with a superscript. Treat as a single character. 
o Strictly speaking, the answer to #8 is a single character but we can assign a separate point for the the 
superscript. 
 
#11: by mistake, this was blank in early versions of the test paper, so give everyone 1 point, regardless of 
performance. 
 
Score positively – 1 for each target word, ignore extra non-target words 
 
Score generously – if different scores are possible, choose the highest. 
 
Accept  
o any size of Inukititut characters 
o non-English spellings e.g. Lili.

Commentary 
Here’s a convenient summary of the Inuktitut writing system (from Omniglot.com): 
 
 
As you can see, there’s a great deal more to the system than competitors need to discover in order to solve the 
problem:  
 
It’s basically a syllabary, so most characters correspond to a consonant followed by a vowel. 
 
There’s a very limited range of consonants and vowels: 14 consonants and three vowels (which can be either 
long or short). 
 
The long vowels are shown by a raised dot which doesn’t appear in any of the test words. 
 
Each consonant has a different shape which appears consistently in all syllables. (Exceptionally, k and n have 
the same shape but in different orientations.) 
 
Vowels are distinguished by the orientation of this shape. 
 
When a consonant is at the end of a syllable, without a following vowel, it is written as a superscript (shown 
in the bottom rows).  
 
When a vowel has no preceding consonant, it is shown as a triangle (as in the second column).
