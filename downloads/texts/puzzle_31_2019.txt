Problem 5. Chatting in Pitjantjatjara (15 marks) 
You’re a linguist researching Pitjantjatjara, an Australian Aboriginal language 
with about 3,000  speakers found in the desert of Central Australia, near Uluru. 
Searching through the archives, you find a dusty notebook with some 
handwritten stories. The alphabet uses some underlined letters for sounds that 
don’t exist in English, and ‘ng’ is used at the start of words.  
The linguist who recorded this conversation forgot to translate or transcribe 
some of the sentences, numbered 1 to 11; your task is to fill in these gaps. Pay attention to your 
Pitjantjatjara spelling! And please note that the conversation continues on the next page.

Commentary 
 
Noun and pronoun endings 
Pitjantjatjara is a ‘split’ case marking language, which means that pronouns and nouns are 
marked differently for case. An important contrast depends on whether a verb has an object 
or not; if it does, it’s ‘transitive’, but if not, ‘intransitive’. For pronouns, the pattern is the 
same as for English pronouns: the subjects of transitive and intransitive verbs have the same 
form (‘nominative’), but the object of transitive verbs has a different form (‘accusative’). For 
nouns, however, the subject of a transitive verb has a special form (called ‘ergative’ – think 
‘energy’) while the object has the same form as the subject of an intransitive verb 
(unmarked).  
• Pronouns 
 
person sg 
dual 
plural 
1 
ngayulu(NOM)/ngayunya(ACC) ngali 
nganaṉa 
2 
nyuntu 
nyupali 
nyura 
3 
paluṟu(NOM)/palunya(ACC) 
 
tjana 
 
• Nouns: 
o Ergative:  -lu 
o Unmarked: no ending. 
• Other preposition-like endings 
o Reason (‘for'): -ku 
o Locative (‘in/on’): -ngka on common nouns and pronouns, -la on names 
o Allative (‘to’): -kutu on common noun, but with names this is added to the 
locative form, giving -la-kutu. 
Verb endings 
Tense endings: Verbs are divided into different verb classes. We see three of them in this data 
set. 
• n-class -nu ‘past’ -nanyi ‘present’ (a- ‘go’) 
• l-class -ṉu ‘past’ (paḻtju ‘step on’) 
• 0-class -ngu ‘past’ -nyi ‘present’ 
 
Word order 
Word order is fairly free but verbs tend to be final.
