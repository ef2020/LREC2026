4. Haitian (10 marks) 
Haitian Creole is a language spoken by about 10 million people in Haiti. It is based 
largely on French and some African languages. In the spelling, the combinations an, 
en, and on denote nasal vowels. The table below contains nouns in Haitian Creole 
combined with definite articles, meaning ‘the’. The English translation is just for the 
noun itself; so kòl la means ‘the necktie’, and kòl means ‘necktie’.

Comment 
• The challenge is to work out what determines the form of the article. In 
metropolitan French, the determinant is partly phonological (l’ before a vowel, 
as in l’enfant, the child) but mainly grammatical: masculine singular le, 
feminine singular la, plural les. In Haitian, however, it turns out that the main 
determinant is phonology, with grammar playing a smaller part (the plural is 
always yo). 
• What, then, are the possible forms for the singular? There are just five: 
o a, an, la, lan, nan. 
o these differ in two places : 
▪ first consonant: l, n, nothing 
▪ last consonant: n, nothing 
• n is a nasal consonant, along with m.  
o Notice that the introduction tells us that an, en and on are nasal vowels, 
so nasality is important. (Nasal sounds have breath escaping through 
the nose.)  
o Notice too that only those three combinations of letters are for nasal 
vowels – not, for example, in or am (unlike metropolitan French). 
• Since you can see that these are related, it would be helpful to lay them out in 
a table in the hope of finding patterns, with A1-3 and B1-3 as the possible 
determining conditions; so for example when we have patterns A1+B1 we find 
a: 
a 
an 
 
B1 
la 
lan 
 
B2 
 
 
nan 
B3 
A1 
A2 
A3 
 
• What then are these patterns? 
o A1: this is the normal pattern. 
o A2: when the noun’s last vowel is either a nasal vowel or follows a 
nasal consonant. 
o A3: when the noun ends in a nasal consonant. 
o B1: when the noun ends in a vowel. 
o B2: when the noun ends in a non-nasal consonant (including y) 
o B3: as for A3.
