2026 – Round 1
Problem 2. Iñupiaq (20 marks)
The Inuit are a group of Indigenous peoples native to northern
Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. Their language varies across the
continent; this problem is based on the dialect of Northwest Arctic
borough, Alaska (pictured in red), where an Inuit might refer to
themselves as an Iñupiaq (pl. Iñupiat).
Most languages, including both English and Iñupiaq, have pro-
cesses that allow speakers to create new words from old words, with different but related meanings.
For example, English -er turns a verb into something or someone that does the verb (e.g. washer,
drinker, helper), and -able makes an adjective meaning possible (e.g. doable, drinkable). This process is
regular enough that you know what helpable and doer mean, even if you have never seen the words
before.
On the next page are some sets of Iñupiaq words, each with one or more English translations.
The words in these groups are all related to each other by processes similar to the English processes
described.
Blanket-tossing is a game involving tossing someone into the air by bouncing them off of a dried
animal skin, which can make a loud snapping noise. Sinew or tendon is the tissue which joins muscle
to bone; many pre-industrial societies dried it to use as thread. A skin boat is a traditional Iñupiat
boat, where the sides are made from seal skin stretched over a wooden frame; a steamboat is a boat
with an engine powered by burning coal to generate heat. A shaman is a person in traditional Iñupiat
religion believed to be able to interact with the spirit world. A reindeer (also known as caribou) is a
species of deer common across the north of Eurasia and North America, and the primary species of
deer found inside the Arctic circle; they are similar in size and appearance to the red deer found in
the UK, though typically with a grey-brown coat.
Q 2.1 Fill in the gaps (a)–(l).
Q 2.2 The white-winged scoter or killalik is a species of sea duck found mostly in Alaska and Canada.
What is the literal translation of its Iñupiaq name?
Q 2.3 Many Iñupiat children play a game that translates as little devil. What is the Iñupiaq name of
the game?
Q 2.4 Given that the word kikmik can refer to the heel part of the foot, which type of footwear is
now known as kikmikpalik in Iñupiaq?
Q 2.5 The Iñupiaq words uqsruŋŋuaq and uqsrupiaq refer to two kinds of oil commonly used by the
Iñupiat. One refers to oil made from pressing the seeds of the castor plant native to tropical
regions, and the other refers to oil made from animal fat, often seal. Which is which? Suggest
two-word literal translations of each word.

Maximum 36 pts.
Q 2.1 Max 24. For translations into English: 2 pts for a correct answer. Accept any answers with
meanings of small letter; thing an inhabited place has = thing a mannequin/puppet is an artifical version of;
fake/artificial face; and thing that is cleaned off of a gun or oven. For example, do not allow inhabitant
for e., veil for g., or gunpowder for i. If an answer is not clearly incorrect, but you are unsure if
it is a close enough translation to the examples given, you may award 1 pt.
For translations into Iñupiaq: 2 pts if correct; 1 pt with one mistake (i.e. missing/extra/incorrect
letter). Do not penalise missing/extra/incorrect diacritics (g for ġ, l for ɫ, or n for ñ).
For c, award 1 pt for ikniqtaq or ikniqtapiaq. For l, award 1 pt for umiaqtalik.
Q 2.2 Max 2. As in Q2.1. 2 pts if correct. Accept any answer which is a reasonable phrasing of
the idea thing that possesses/is characterised/has by hole(s). Allow thing/person for thing, or similar
phrasing. Award 1 pt for any answer that has the idea of possessing/being characterised by
holes. E.g. bird with holes, person with holes score 1 pt.
Q 2.3 Max 2. As in Q2.1. 2 pts if correct; 1 pt with one mistake (e.g. missing/extra/incorrect letter).
Do not penalise missing/extra/incorrect diacritics.
Q 2.4 Max 2. 2 pts if correct, or for a reasonable identification of large-heeled shoes (e.g. stilettos, ankle
boots; do not simply allow boots). Award 1 pt for an answer expressing the idea of “thing/shoe
possessing/characterised by large heels”, without naming a type of shoe.
Q 2.5 Max 6 pts. Award 2 pts if both ticks are correct. Award 2 pts per literal translation (no partial
marks). Accept any reasonable literal translations which capture the ideas of uqsruŋŋuaq being
a fake/artificial oil, and uqsrupiaq being the real/traditional Iñupiaq oil. Be generous; do not
penalise minor/irrelevant differences from the given translations, e.g. cooking oil instead of oil.

Problem 2. Iñupiaq Commentary
• Nouns can take the following suffixes:
– N–pak = large N
– N–uraq = small N
– N–lik = thing that has N, thing that is characterised by N
– N–un = tool for N
– N–iya-un = tool that removes N
– N–piaq = real N, Iñupiat N
– N–ŋŋuaq = fake/artificial N
– N–taq = product of N
• Before suffixes other than -pak and -taq, the final consonant is dropped.
