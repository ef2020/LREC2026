Problem 10. Filomeno Mata Totonac (25 marks) 
Ideophones are a type of word found in some languages that, as well as 
having a literal meaning, evoke a sensory image. They are the only major 
part of speech that is not found in English, although verbs like glimmer 
and clink are comparable.   
Filomeno Mata Totonac (FMT), a variety of the Totonac language family 
spoken in Mexico, has ideophones, which often come in series of 
different intensities - compare the English verbs clink, clank, clunk. 
Below are some examples of ideophones in FMT, along with examples of 
how they could be used. But beware, one of the words given in the table 
is not a real ideophone! 
Note that š is the sh in ship; q is similar to k in milk but pronounced further back in the mouth; ʔ is the 
glottal stop, the consonant in the middle of uh-oh; ɬ is the Welsh ll in Llanelli, a sound similar to l. 
 
 
1 Mildew is a fungus similar to mould, known for a distinctive foul smell.

Problem 10. Filomeno Explanation (2/2) 
 
Explanation 
 
There are three consonant series: S = {s, š, ɬ}, T = {ts, tš, tɬ}, K = {k, q}. 
There are also three vowel set: A = {a}, I = {i, e}, U = {u,o}. 
Ideophones fall into four categories: 
● “Colours” have the form C1 (C) V1 C1/2 V2 C2 V2. 
o Note C1 must be in S or T, while C2 must be in K. 
o V1 and V2 must be from the same vowel set. 
o Moving C1 up the series makes the colour paler. 
 
● “Shapes” have the form C1 (C) V1 C2 V1 C2 V1. 
 
● “Sounds/motions” are one word repeated, which must contain at least one consonant from S, T 
or K. 
“Odours/flavours” can have any form, but must contain at least one consonant from S, T or K, 
usually two. 
o Words that differ only by consonants in the same series, and vowels in the same set 
have related meanings. 
o Typically, moving up the consonant series creates a “heavier” or “stronger” sensation. 
Note that you do not need to figure out all of this explanation to completely solve the problem.
