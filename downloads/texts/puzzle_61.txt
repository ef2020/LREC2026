UKLO Round 1 2012 
2. Danish numbers (5 marks) 
Here are some examples of Danish numbers: 
 
3 = tre 
4 = fire 
5 = fem 
6 = seks 
7 = syv 
20 = tyve 
30 = tredive    
40 = fyrre 
57 = syvoghalvtreds 
60 = tres 
78 = otteoghalvfjerds 
80 = firs

SOLUTION 
How to mark an UKLO script 
Terminology 
• target: the correct answer; e.g. ‘A B C d’ (where X, Y and Z are wrong) 
• script answer: the answer in the script you’re marking; e.g. ‘A X C D’. 
• point: a number that you assign, which the spreadsheet eventually translates 
into a ‘mark’; e.g. 1 for A 
• unit: a part of the target that carries a point; e.g. A, X and C. Typically a unit 
is a word, a phrase or a word-part. 
• sign: a ‘mark’ that you make on each unit in the script. 
o tick: on a completely right unit; e.g. on A and C 
o cross: on a completely wrong unit; e.g. on X 
o half: on a partly right unit; e.g. on D (for d) 
 
Example: 
 
 
 
½  
A 
X 
C 
d 
 
• score: the number you assign to the entire script, following the directions in 
the marking scheme. 
Principles 
• Each correct unit or partly right unit in the script answer increases the score. 
• Completely wrong units in the script answer are penalised simply by not 
increasing the score. 
o e.g. A X C d scores 3 because X scores 0.  
• Similarly, units in the target that are missing from the script answer are 
penalised simply by not increasing the score. 
o e.g. A C d scores 3 because only A, C and d score anything. 
• But if the script answer contains more units than the target, the surplus units 
should be penalised.  
o e.g. A B C d X scores 3 because X scores -1, though A B C d score 4. 
• No score should be worse than a completely blank answer, so there are no 
negative scores. 
o e.g. A B C d X Y Z Z Z scores 0, because althought each X, Y and Z 
reduces the score by 1, the effect stops when the score reaches 0.  
How to score 
1. Follow the marking sheet for  
a. recognising units 
b. assigning ticks and halves 
c. assigning points for ticks and halves.

2. Count the units in the script answer and compare this number with the number 
of units in the target. If the script answer contains more units than the target, 
go to 4. Otherwise (i.e. in the vast majority of cases) go to 3. 
3. Add up all the points for ticks and halves. That’s the score. 
4. As in 3, but then deduct the number of surplus units, i.e. the difference 
between the numbers of units in the script answer and in the target.

Comments on Danish 
This is slightly tricky because some Danish numbers are based not on ten (as in 
English) but on scores (a score is 20), as in English ‘three score and ten’, and of these 
numbers, some count ten (halv = half a score) back from the next (rather like the 
German time system, where halb sechs literally means ‘half six’ but actually means 
‘half past five’). Once you’ve grasped this general point about the system, everything 
is straightforward:  
• og means ‘and’,  
• the individual numbers are more or less obvious 
• but the ‘scores’ numbers have two forms, for use with and without halv; for 
example, 80 is firs but in 78, firs is replaced by fjerds.  
Notice a trick often used in the Olympiad: the first question contains Danish data that 
you need in order to answer the second question. (Moral: use every scrap of 
information we give you!) In Q1, fireogtres tells you that tres doesn’t change to treds 
when combined with a following number, but just after halv.
