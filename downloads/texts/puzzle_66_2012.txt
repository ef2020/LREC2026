2. Who is good? (15 marks) 
Luiseño is a Uto-Aztecan language spoken in southern California. Although it has 
only about 30 or 40 native speakers now, there is an active campaign to teach it to 
children. It has no standard written form, and is not widely used in writing except in 
schools. One way to represent it is to use the International Phonetic Alphabet, as in 
the following examples; by convention, IPA symbols are enclosed in square brackets. 
The pronunciations don’t matter for the problem, but you may like to know that:  
 
[ʔ] is a glottal stop, the sound in the middle of uh-oh.  
[q] is like a k but made further back in the mouth.  
[ʃ] is a “sh” sound as in shout  
[j] is a “y” sound as in yellow.  
[ʂ] is like an “s”, but made with the tongue-tip curled back.  
[x] is a “ch” sound roughly as in Irish deich, or Scots loch,  or German Bach.  
[ŋ] is the nasal “ng” sound in singer.  
[:] indicates a long vowel.  
 
This transcription shows how words are pronounced, but when we speak we don’t 
normally pause between words, so it is traditional not to show word-breaks in a 
phonetic transcription.  
 
Here are some sentences in Luiseño and their English translations.
