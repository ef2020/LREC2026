Problem 5. Arhuaco things & places (15 marks) 
Arhuaco is a language spoken by the Arhuaco 
people in Northern Colombia, who still live 
traditionally and use their language widely. It is 
estimated that of the 8,000 speakers of Arhuaco, 
90% are monolingual, with only a minority also 
speaking Spanish, Colombia’s main language. The 
language is also known by a host of other names, 
including Ica and Bintuk.  
Arhuaco is written here with some special characters, but these are not relevant for solving the problem.

Solution and marking. 
Scoring: (max 24) 
• Q5.1: 0 points per correct first word and for in kintari  
 
 
 
[max 12] 
o 1 point per correct part of the last word (the verb). 
o Assume every verb has two parts: direction + classification 
o Parts are separated below by +, and missing parts are shown as _, but + and _ are not 
expected in the answers! 
o _+gaka = two parts – i.e. the first part may be zero. So if the correct answer is _+gaka, the 
following both score 1: _+sa,  kᴧ+gaka. 
o The correct form for (f) is actually aɁnɨ kᴧ+ssa, but the predictable form is aɁnɨ kᴧ+sa.

Commentary 
Arhuaco has different verbs for expressing putting objects in a particular place or position. As well as that, 
the shape of the object being put somewhere also matters for the type of verb that is used. 
In this puzzle, there are three different types of objects with regard to shape, and there is one position 
used, namely ‘upright’: 
Shape 
Items 
Arhuaco verb for 
put down 
Arhuaco verb for 
put in something 
Arhuaco verb for 
put up on 
something 
flat 
book, plate, poster 
_+pan 
kᴧ+pas 
i+pan 
long 
stick, machete, sword, 
rolled up poster in tube-
shape, needle, pencil 
_+gaka 
kᴧ+gaka 
i+geika 
3D 
rock, house, hat, sack of 
corn 
_+sa 
kᴧ+sa 
i+sa 
upright  
book on shelf, plate in 
drying rack 
_+tšoɁs 
kᴧ+tšoɁs 
i+tšo 
As long as items are not understood as upright, it is their shape in terms of being flat, long or 3D that 
matters. But as soon as an item is clearly put upright, like a book on a shelf, a plate in a drying rack or a hat, 
then the verb form for ‘upright’ must be used. 
The system for Arhuaco verbs that mean “place something” is more complex than this problem’s examples, 
there are verbs for items that are positioned into a tight-fitting container (like a foot in a sock or a machete 
in a sheath), as well as verbs for liquids. There are also additional positions which take their own verbs.
