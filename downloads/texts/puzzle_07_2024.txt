2024 – Round 1
Problem 3. Khmer (10 marks)
Cambodia is a country in South-East Asia, bordered by Thailand, Laos
and Vietnam. The vast majority of the population are Khmer, which is
also the name of the official language, spoken by about 18 million people.
The Khmer script is one of the oldest recorded in South-East Asia and is
based on an ancient script from Southern India.
Below is an extract from the menu of a Cambodian restaurant, with
English translations of each dish. English words in brackets are added for
clarity, but do not correspond to any Khmer word. You do not need to
know how any Khmer words are pronounced to solve this problem.
Note that buffalo is a cow-like animal, kept for its meat and milk in Asia. Tofu is a vegetarian food
made from soya beans.

Problem 3. Khmer Explanations
Q 3.1
dishes
suitable for vegetarians?
a. កូកុងôបច់បÛ្គប
No. Highlighted is the word for shrimp).
b. គុយèបវទឹក។្រតី
No. Highlighted is the word for fish).
c. ëបយÝប
Yes. This means fried rice.
d. ôបöបត់õបេĎបហ៊ូ
Yes. This means tofu salad.
e. គុយèបវស៊ុតôបôបច់ïបន់
No. We don’t know what the highlighted
word is, but it’s some sort of meat. (Ac-
tually, it’s chicken.)
Q 3.2 ôបច់only appears in dishes with meat (not fish or vegetarian options; however, it does
occur with shrimp). In a similar manner, English makes a distinction between the live animals
with ‘cow’ and ‘pig’ for example, and when referring to the meat of these animals, English uses
‘beef’ and ‘pork’ instead.
Q 3.3 Literally: liquid (something) cow
