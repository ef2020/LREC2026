Problem 1. Taiwan Paiwan (20 marks) 
Paiwan is a minority language in Taiwan/Republic of 
China, spoken by around 66,000 native speakers in the 
southern region of the island. One of the major 
components of Paiwan syntax is “focus”, which 
applies to the new piece of information that the 
sentence is conveying. In English, this can be represented by sentences like “It is the dog which the 
man likes”: in this example, the dog is focused. 
Below are some sentences in Paiwan with their English translations. Sentence elements in italics 
are focused. (The digraph dj represents a single sound. The word langedaen in sentence 8 is actually 
langedain, but this was edited for the sake of simplicity.)

Round 2 
 
 
Commentary 
Paiwan has 4 types of focus in a sentence: Agent Focus (AF), Patient Focus (PF), Referent Focus 
(RF) and Instrument Focus (IF). Depending on which element of a sentence is focused, the verb 
conjugates differently. 
Agent – subject of transitive verb 
Patient – object of transitive verb 
Referent – location/time/beneficiary of action 
Instrument – instrument/cause/motivation of action 
The affixes are: 
AF: -m- after initial consonant 
PF: -en 
RF: -an 
IF: si- 
The article of the noun phrase changes depending on whether it is focused or not: 
a = focused element/equational construction marker (CM=) 
tua = unfocused non-agent 
nua = unfocused agent/genitive construction marker (CMgen) 
CM= means that two elements are equal to each other or describe each other. 
Another way that you could look at these constructions is that the verbal affixes are derivational 
morphemes that change the verb into a noun, i.e. kan = eat, k-m-an = the one who eats, si-kan = 
the thing with which one eats. In this instance, the agent becomes the ‘possessor’ of the new noun 
and so goes into the genitive case (nua). 
Both these explanations describe the same data and either would lead to a correct interpretation. 
Finally, there are also the prefixes ku- and su- which refer to the 1st and 2nd person singular 
respectively. When attached to nouns they indicate possession, and to verbs they indicate agency 
(although with the derivational theory, the verbs have become nouns anyway).
