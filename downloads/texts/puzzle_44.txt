Commentary 
This problem is mainly about the pronouns for first and second persons singular. Just like languages 
such as French, Spanish, Modern Greek and Arabic, Choctaw treats these as affixes, rather than as 
separate words as in English. The main issue in this problem is how these pronouns are used for 
showing possession, as in ‘my dog’ or ‘your mother’.  
A verb can in principle consist of 5 morphemes: #-2 + #-1 + Base +  #1 + #2 
 
Slots #-2 and #1 are for subject pronouns. If there is no such pronoun, the subject is third 
person ‘he/she’. 
 
Slot #-1 is for object pronouns (e.g. is-sa-piisa-tok, ‘you saw me’) 
 
Slot #2 is for a tense marker (-tok ‘past’, -h ‘present’ plus details not relevant here) 
Each of the first two persons has three different sets of pronoun affixes, which we can call sets A, B 
and C: 
 
Set A 
Set B 
Set C 
first person singular 
-li 
sa- 
am- 
second person singula 
ish- (is- before s) 
chi- 
chim- 
 
 
Set A: subject of a verb (-li is a suffix at #1, but ish- is a prefix at #-2),e.g. piisa-li-tok, ‘I saw’, 
ish-piisa-tok, ‘you saw’. 
 
Set B:  
o direct object of a verb at #-1, e.g. sa-piisa-tok ‘he/she saw me’ 
o subject of an adjective, e.g. sa-niya-h ‘I am fat’ 
o ‘inalienable’ possessor of a noun, e.g. sa-yyi ‘my leg’, sa-shki ‘my mother’ 
 
Set C: 
o indirect object of a verb at #-1, e.g. am-anoli-tok ‘he/she told me’ 
o ‘alienable’ possessor of a noun, e.g. am-ofi ‘my dog’ 
Alienable possession is for things that we may or may not have (e.g. ‘dog’), in contrast with the 
inalienable possession of family members (e.g. ‘mother’) and body parts (e.g. ‘leg’). The distinction is 
relevant to Choctaw grammar in two ways: 
 
Alienable and inalienable possession use different pronoun forms as shown above. 
 
Both kinds of possession can be shown by a pronoun attached to the possessed noun, but 
inalienable possession can also be marked on the verb or adjective (e.g. Chi-shki-t chi-
niyah, ‘Your mother is fat’) 
Nouns have suffix –at (-t after a vowel) if they are subject (e.g. Johnat niyah, ‘John is fat’).
