Problem 6. Māori for the beach (15 marks) 
Māori is the indigenous language of New Zealand and is one of the official languages of that country, 
spoken by about 4% of the population. It is a Polynesian language like many of the languages spoken 
in the Pacific area.  
Here are some examples. Fill cells 1-12. (NB ‘ā’ and ‘ō’ are long vowels; the length matters.)

Commentary 
This is all about syntax except for one small detail about morphology.  
1. Basic sentence structure is Tense + Verb + Subject + X, where  
a. Tense is ka/i/kuo for future/past/perfect 
b. X is anything else. 
2. But X may also be negative (kāore). In that case, the structure is Neg + Subject + Tense + 
Verb + X, where Tense is e/i for future/past. 
3. ‘The’ = te/ngā for for singular/plural  
4. In ‘emphatic’ sentences, the structure is Tense-1 + Subject + X + Tense-2 + Verb*, where 
a. Tense-1 is mā/nā for future/past  
b. Tense-2 is e/i  for future/past  (agreeing with Tense-1) 
c. Verb* is a special form of the normal verb 
5. Verb* is a reduced version of the verb’s normal form: 
a. horoi < horoia 
b. whai < whaia 
c. kōrero < korerotia   
6. Transitive sentences combine an active Agent with an inactive Patient:  
a. Basic sentences: Agent = Subject, Patient = X, introduced by i.  
b. Passive sentences: Patient = Subject, Agent = X, introduced by e.  
c. NB the verb forms are the same, unlike English.
