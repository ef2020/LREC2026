Problem 2. Jam Sai (5 marks) 
Jam Sai (sometimes spelled Jamsay) is a Dogon language spoken in Mali and 
Burkina Faso, by about 130,000 speakers.  
Below are some verb pairs in the Jam Sai language with their meanings.  
Note that ɣ is a consonant; ɛ and ɔ are vowels; ñ is like the ny in canyon; ŋ 
the ng in sing. The superscript n indicates that the previous sound is nasalised 
– pronounced with air coming out of the nose. Jam Sai is a tonal language, but 
tones have not been written as they are not relevant to this problem.

Explanation 
 
The data show two types of verb derivation: one causative (to make something happen) and the other 
negative or opposite. 
 
In both cases, an infix is inserted before the final vowel, consisting of a copy of the first vowel of the 
stem, then w for the causative, r for the negative. In addition, if there is a nasal consonant (m, n, ñ, ŋ) 
anywhere in the stem, the r or the w is nasalised. 
 
Note that this can also be analysed as a suffix that changes the final vowel of the stem.
