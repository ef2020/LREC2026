UKLO Round 1 2012 
5. Esperanto (15 marks) 
Esperanto is an artificial language created by Ludwig Lazarus Zamenhof in 1887 and 
designed for international communication. Estimates of the number of active and 
fluent speakers range from 100,000 to 2,000,000 people all around the world, with a 
few hundred native speakers. The letters ‘ĝ’ and ‘ĉ’ are pronounced like ‘g’ and ‘ch’ 
in the words ‘gem’ and ‘chase’.

How to mark an UKLO script 
Terminology 
• target: the correct answer; e.g. ‘A B C d’ (where X, Y and Z are wrong) 
• script answer: the answer in the script you’re marking; e.g. ‘A X C D’. 
• point: a number that you assign, which the spreadsheet eventually translates 
into a ‘mark’; e.g. 1 for A 
• unit: a part of the target that carries a point; e.g. A, X and C. Typically a unit 
is a word, a phrase or a word-part. 
• sign: a ‘mark’ that you make on each unit in the script. 
o tick: on a completely right unit; e.g. on A and C 
o cross: on a completely wrong unit; e.g. on X 
o half: on a partly right unit; e.g. on D (for d) 
 
Example: 
 
 
 
½  
A 
X 
C 
d 
 
• score: the number you assign to the entire script, following the directions in 
the marking scheme. 
Principles 
• Each correct unit or partly right unit in the script answer increases the score. 
• Completely wrong units in the script answer are penalised simply by not 
increasing the score. 
o e.g. A X C d scores 3 because X scores 0.  
• Similarly, units in the target that are missing from the script answer are 
penalised simply by not increasing the score. 
o e.g. A C d scores 3 because only A, C and d score anything. 
• But if the script answer contains more units than the target, the surplus units 
should be penalised.  
o e.g. A B C d X scores 3 because X scores -1, though A B C d score 4. 
• No score should be worse than a completely blank answer, so there are no 
negative scores. 
o e.g. A B C d X Y Z Z Z scores 0, because althought each X, Y and Z 
reduces the score by 1, the effect stops when the score reaches 0.  
How to score 
1. Follow the marking sheet for  
a. recognising units 
b. assigning ticks and halves 
c. assigning points for ticks and halves.

2. Count the units in the script answer and compare this number with the 
number of units in the target. If the script answer contains more units than the 
target, go to 4. Otherwise (i.e. in the vast majority of cases) go to 3. 
3. Add up all the points for ticks and halves. That’s the score. 
4. As in 3, but then deduct the number of surplus units, i.e. the difference 
between the numbers of units in the script answer and in the target. 
 
 
 
Q5. Esperanto (15 marks, 18 points) 
• Ignore ‘@1’!!! 
• 3 per correct answer. 
• 1 for correct choice of first tense (‘will’, present (e.g. is, has) or past (e.g. was, 
had)) in 1-3. 
• 1 for correct choice of second tense (going to or have (e.g. had)) in 1-3. 
• 1 for correct passive voice (been eaten/chased) in 2, 3. 
• 1 for each correct vowel choice (i/a/o) in the verb ending in 4-6. 
• 1 for each correct use of t or nt in the verb ending in 4-6. 
• 1 for just kapron (with –on) in 6. 
• No marks just for nouns (goat, cat, dog) or verb (eat, chase). 
• Accept any order of la kapro(n), la hundo and verb. 
• Deduct ½ for accidental use of wrong word (e.g. chased for eaten; antis for 
manĝantis).
