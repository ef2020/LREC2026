Problem 3. Watsonium (10 marks) 
Or: Eilimintach mo Watson daor  (Elementary my dear Watson) 
Irish (or “Gaeilge”) is a language spoken by roughly 1.3 million people in Ireland. The earliest 
examples of written Irish date from the fourth century, but this problem is about modern Irish, 
which includes foreign loan words based on Latin, Greek or English. The Irish spelling of a loan word 
follows the pronunciation rather than the spelling of the original. 
The table below shows the Irish names for some of the chemical elements, together with the English 
names for the same elements. In spite of the different spellings, the Irish words have similar 
pronunciations to the corresponding English words. The acute accent on a vowel (e.g. é) shows that 
it is long. Just in case you’re not familiar with the English names and their pronunciation, where ‘e’, 
‘o’ and ‘u’ are underlined they have a pronunciation like the ‘ee’ in feet, the ‘o’ in rope and snore and 
the ‘u’ in rule. The ending ium on English words is always pronounced as in medium.

Scoring: one point for each correct answer. (Max 14) 
 
No half marks – correct is 100% correct. 
 
Ignore capital letters 
 
Accept Irish vowels with or without the accent. 
 
Accept English misspellings or incorrect words if they’re plausible (e.g. phosphor or fosfor for 
phosphorus), but not if they’re simply copies of the Irish (e.g. fosfar).  
Comment 
The aim of this problem is to focus on regularities in the way in which Irish spelling treats words 
borrowed from English. The examples included do in fact follow regular rules, though other 
examples that could have been included break these rules.  
The Irish spellings are clearly very different from the English spellings, so they must be based on the 
English word’s pronunciation, regardless of how this is shown in English spelling. What, then, are the 
rules relating Irish spellings to English spellings? 
 
consonants stay the same, except that: 
o English double consonants => Irish single consonant (e.g. <ll> => <l> - i.e. English <ll> 
changes to Irish <l>) 
o English <x> => Irish <cs>  
o <th> => <t> 
 
vowels stay the same, except that: 
o <u> => <a> in  –ium  
o <y> => <i> 
o <e/u/a/o> => < e/u/a/o + i> before <i/y> in the next syllable. 
The last rule is at the heart of the problem. It is an example of a ‘vowel-harmony’ rule in which a 
vowel ‘harmonises with’ the vowel in the next syllable by becoming more similar to it. In this case, 
the change contrasts the vowel pronounced /i/ and spelt either <i> or <y> with all the others; so /i/ 
in one syllable, even if it’s combined with another vowel, triggers an extra /i/ in the preceding 
syllable unless this already contains /i/.
