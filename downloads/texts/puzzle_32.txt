Commentary 
Ndebele verbs have prefixes to mark the subject: 
ngi-  
-  
1st person singular 
u- 
- 
2nd person singular or 3rd person singular 
si- 
- 
1st person plural 
ba-  
-  
3rd person plural 
There is also the prefix uku-, marking the infinitive, and the infix -ya-, which marks a verb with no 
“following” word, either an object or an adverb. It is still used when the verb is followed by the 
question particles na or angithi (marking a “tag” question). 
The question-word adverbs njani and ngaphi can also act as verbs (“Where is she?” = “She 
wheres?”), in which case they take the subject prefixes above. 
The Ndebele nouns given here are marked by the prefix um- in the singular and aba- in the plural.
