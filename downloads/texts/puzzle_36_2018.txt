Problem 1. (In)definitely Romanian (5 marks) 
Romanian is spoken by about 26 million people in Romania and Moldova, and (as its 
name suggests)  it is descended from Latin (the language of Rome). How does Romanian 
say ‘a’ and ‘the’? Use these examples to find out, and fill in the blanks (marked with ‘?’) 
in the table. Note that a and ă are pronounced differently and that the difference 
matters.

Commentary 
The point of this problem is to analyse the area of Romanian grammar that deals with definite and indefinite 
articles. As in other Romance (descended from Latin) languages, the form of the article depends on the 
noun to which it is attached, but unlike other such languages, the definite article appears as a suffix on the 
noun (a feature that it shares with neighbouring Balkan languages such as Bulgarian).  
The nouns in this exercise fall into two groups: 
1. masculine nouns, which all end in a consonant. 
2. feminine nouns, which end in e or ă. 
(There is actually a third gender, ‘neuter’, but this isn’t represented here.) Since the genders can also be 
identified by their last letter, competitors don’t need to recognise genders; indeed, the last two words 
require them to classify a word solely on the basis of its form. 
 
class 1 
class 2 
indefinite  
un  
o 
definite 
-ul 
-a 
 
The only complication is that when –a is added after ă the latter disappears, leaving just –a.
