Problem 1. Nancowry Commentary
There are three derivations: the causative (CAUS), which turns an adjective or verb into a verb
meaning to make / cause X; the instrumental nominaliser (INSTR), which turns a verb into a noun
meaning a thing used to X; and the object nominaliser (OBJ), which turns a transitive verb into a noun
meaning a thing that is Xed.
The marking chosen depends on the number of syllables in the base.
1 syllable
>1 syllable
CAUS
ha-
<um>
INSTR
<an>
<in>
OBJ
-a
-a
All infixes appear after the initial consonant. For <um> and <in>, the infix replaces the following
vowel.
