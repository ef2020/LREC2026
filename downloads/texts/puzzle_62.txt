Comments on Welsh libraries 
Generally a straightforward problem, but the questions get harder because the later 
questions build on patterns that emerge while you’re answering earlier questions. 
• To find the Welsh for Anglesey, find all the places where Anglesey occurs in the 
English and see what’s special about their Welsh equivalents; and do the same for 
all the other words 1-10. These questions merely ask you to retrieve information 
from the data. 
• 11-14: These questions ask you to put words together, which is straightforward so 
long as you follow the word order of Welsh, not English. 
• 15: This question is about two basic characteristics of Welsh which you can work 
out from the data: 
• singular-plural differences. You can find llyfrau translating books in several 
places, but in Ceisiadau llyfrau it is translated as the singular: book requests. To 
understand what is going on here you have to first recognise that the English book 
requests means the same as requests for books (where books is plural), and 
secondly to recognise that the -au at the end of llyfrau is the same as on the plural 
ceisiadau ('requests'), and that the remainder of the word, llyfr is also found in 
llyfrgell, 'library' - i.e. a library is a book-place (gell in fact means 'place'). (You 
might find it helpful to relate llyfr to the French livre or even to the libr- of 
English library.) In short, llyfrau is in fact the plural of llyfr, 'book'.  
• ‘mutation’, a peculiarity of all Celtic languages, whereby initial consonants mutate 
(change) from one sentence context to another. This is why some words have two 
forms (e.g. llyfrgell or lyfrgell; cyfrifiaduron or gyfrifiaduron). This question asks 
you to spot that in the phrase unrhyw lyfrgell, ‘any library’, the ll of llyfrgell 
changes to l, and to apply the same rule in constructing ‘any books’.
