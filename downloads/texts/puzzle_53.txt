Problem 10. Georgian  verbs (25 marks)    
Georgian is spoken by about four million people in Georgia, a country on the Eastern coast 
of the Black Sea, south of the Caucasus mountains (not to be confused with the American 
state called Georgia!). The modern Georgian alphabet has been in use for about four 
centuries.  Below are twelve Georgian sentences  with  their  English  translations.  All  of  the  verbs  
in  the  sentences  below  follow  a  regular  pattern.

Nouns as objects 
Nouns have (at least) 
two forms when apparently being used as the verb’s object. The two relevant examples are shown 
below, with an alternation between -ს/s 
/s 
/s 
/s and -ი/i/i/i/i . The choice of noun form depends on the verb’s 
tense. 
door
letter
A) with present tense
კარს 
წერილს 
B) with past tense
კარი 
წერილი     
Nouns as subjects 
At least one subject noun has two forms: Andria is ანდრია in ‘Andria and his mother are receiving 
a package’ but ანდრიამ (with an extra final მ/m
/m
/m
/m) in ‘Andria has written a poem’. This variation is 
presumably due to the verb’s tense (and we see the same extra letter on Ekaterine ეკატერინემ  in 
a past-tense sentence) but it is not found on the first of two coordinated subjects, as in ‘Levan and I’ 
or ‘Eduard and Ekaterine’.
