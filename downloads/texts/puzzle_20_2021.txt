Problem 4. Ditema tsa Dinoko (10 marks) 
The Ditema tsa Dinoko writing system is a recent invention used to transcribe several Bantu 
languages of southern Africa. The writing system was designed to reflect the southern African 
mural art form known as Ditema or Litema, which is made up of decorative geometric patterns. 
Below are some representations of words in the Sesotho language (spoken mainly in Lesotho) in 
the Ditema tsa Dinoko script, along with their equivalents in Roman script and their English 
meanings (which are not relevant to the problem). 
 
lebitso (name) 
 
maseru (Maseru, capital of 
Lesotho) 
 
ŋgoana (child) 
 
toeba (mouse) 
 
pikitla (to rub) 
 
lintoa (wars)

Commentary 
The vowel nucleus of a syllable forms the basic “shape” of a Ditema tsa Dinoko symbol, and the 
consonant markings rotate to match the orientation of the vowel shape. The letter shapes reflect 
the phonetic classification of the sounds concerned and (according to Wikipedia) can be displayed 
in the familiar vowel triangle and consonant chart.
