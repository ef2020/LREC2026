Problem 10. Kaytetye kinship 
The Kaytetye language is spoken in Nothern Australia by a dwindling number of speakers – only 145 were counted in 
2006. This problem focuses on the language’s treatment of family relationships. Its pronouns distinguish singular 
(one person), dual (two people) and plural (more than two), and, as in English, three persons (first: I/we; second: 
you; third: he/she/it/they). Unlike English, however, the dual and plural pronouns, which refer to a group of people, 
also show the family relationships among the members of this group. (Every group is assumed to consist of family 
members.) For instance, the pronoun ayleme refers to a group of two people which includes the speaker, so we 
could translate it as ‘we two’; but these two people must be related according to precise rules which would allow 
one of them to be the other’s brother (for example) but not the other’s father. The rules only allow a single pronoun 
choice for any given group of people.  
To help in talking about these relationships, we can call one member X, where X may be the speaker or the 
addressee (the person addressed), but need not be. This allows us to define the relationship of the other person to 
X, so ayleme means ‘a group of two people including the speaker and  X’s …’ (where the dots allow ‘brother’ among 
many other possibilities). This classification yields nine dual pronouns, distinguished by three persons and three 
relationship-types.  
Q.10.1. Use the answer sheet to fill the empty cells (A-G) in the following table of forms and relationships. Most of 
the forms are built regularly.

The only irregularity is in Set A. 
Semantics 
The three sets are based ultimately on the complex system of social divisions whereby each person is assigned 
automatically to one of two ‘moieties’ (‘halves’ of society) and to one of two ‘generations’ so that  
 
their moiety is the same as their father’s (but not their mother’s); they must marry someone from the other 
moiety. 
 
their generation is different from their father’s, but the same as their grandfather’s. 
However, to solve this problem a candidate doesn’t need to know about moieties and generations because the rules 
can simply refer to the geometrical patterns in a genealogical diagram, like this (with triangles for males and circles 
for females): 
  
The sets can be defined in relation to this diagram: 
 
A: X + Y, where X and Y are linked by an even number of paternal links (i.e. links with a triangle at the top) 
 
B: X + Y, where X and Y are linked by an odd number of paternal links  
 
C: other
