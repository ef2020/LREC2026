Problem 3. Norwedish? (10 marks) 
Norwegian and Swedish are said to be so closely related that speakers of one can 
understand the other – they are mutually comprehensible. Like English, German 
and Dutch, the languages are classified as ‘Germanic’, but they are less closely 
related to English than Dutch is. 
Below are some sentences in both languages with their English translations. Note: 
the accents matter as “a” is different from “ä” or “å” and the meaning of a word 
may depend on exactly which vowel is used.

Commentary 
Some key differences (apart from obvious lexical differences such as the verbs “eat” or “like”) are: 
• 
the formation of the negative: “ikke” for Norwegian, “inte” for Swedish; 
• 
the demonstrative pronoun in Norwegian is the one-word demonstrative pronoun “dette” while 
Swedish has the two-word phrase “det här” (literally: “this here”). 
• 
Most of the language names used in this problem end in  -sk in Norwegian, but -ska in Swedish: 
“svenska” for example. The exception, however is “norsk”, which is the same in both Norwegian and 
Swedish (and this can be worked out in task 3.1 sentence number 9)!  
Grammar-points for the translation task: 
• 
Norwegian and Swedish verbs have the same inflection for every person singular and plural. 
• 
The negators “ikke” or “inte” go after the finite verb (the verb that they are negating). 
• 
These languages differ in the use of articles from other Germanic languages such as English. 
Indefinite articles exist – in this problem the indefinite neuter “ett” (Swedish) – but there are no 
separate definite articles like English “the”. Instead of a definite article in front of the noun, the noun 
receives a suffix. This problem only features the neuter definite forms: “huset” (the house in both 
languages), “toget” (“the train” in Norwegian) and “tåget” (“the train” in Swedish).
