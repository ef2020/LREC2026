Problem 2. Sakata Commentary
1. Syntax:
• Subject – Verb – [Infinitive] – Object
– Verbs take o- in the infinitive, or an agreement prefix for their subject (see below).
•
[o = to] – Noun – Adjective – [LNK – Possessor]
– Adjectives take an agreement prefix.
– In possessive constructions, LNK = agreement prefix for the possessed noun, as a
free-standing linking word.
2. Noun class: all nouns begin with a noun class prefix.
Singular
Plural

Note that here, all noun classes are either singular classes or plural classes. This is not true in
general, although these represent the most common singular–plural pairs.
n-va > mva and ba-nkar > banka.
