Problem 4. What's yours is mine (for eating) (10 marks) 
The Austronesian language Fijian is one of the 
official languages in the island of Fiji, in the 
Pacific to the east of Australia.  
Below you can see a number of phrases in 
Fijian orthography. 
 
ī is a long i and q stands for our ng sound. 
 
Fijian, like many other languages, distinguishes ‘inclusive us’ (including you) and ‘exclusive 
us’ (excluding you). 
 
It also distinguishes singular, dual (two) and plural (more than two). 
 
A yam is an edible root, and kava is a ceremonial drink.

Solution and marking. 
Scoring (max 36)  [NB there was an error in item 12: na kemun i vuaka instead of na kemuni vuaka. 
This error was compounded on the Noticeboard, where it was corrected to ... yuaka. These errors 
are obvious given the very clear pattern in the rest of the data; but I’ve allowed below for answers 
based on the erroneous data. There was also an error in the points for 4.2, which should assign 2 
points, not 1, for each answer-part.] 
 
4.1: 1 point for every correct word other than na (max 24) 
o No half points 
 
4.2: 2 [not: 1] for each correct Fijian phrase and 2 [not: 1] for each correct translation (max 
12) 
o No half points for Fijian  
o 2 [not: 1] points for a correct translation only if paired with the correct Fijian 
phrase 
o In translations, insist on some mention of 
 
drinking for mequ  
 
eating for kequ 
 
ownership, or implied ownership (e.g. selling) for noqu 
o Accept examples in any order.

(Simpliﬁed) System of possessive  in Fijian: 
The syntax shows the kind of relation that exists between the possessor (shown by the suffixed 
pronouns listed above) and the possessed noun (N), using extra words called ‘classifiers’: me, ke or 
no. 
 
no classifier, i.e. N-pronoun: inalienable / direct possessions: (most) body parts & relatives  
 
me+pronoun + N: drinkables / liquids and mushy-soft edibles intended for sucking, slurping 
or drinking 
 
ke+pronoun + N: solid edibles intended to eat; possessor is the subject matter or semantic 
patient 
 
no+pronoun + N: general possessions that don’t belong in the other three categories, where 
the focus is on ownership rather than use; edibles and drinkables used for other purposes 
(e.g. selling, growing)
