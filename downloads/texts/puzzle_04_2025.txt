Problem 2. Fur Commentary
• Word order is Subject – Object – Verb.
• Plural is marked with -à, both on nouns and verbs with plural subjects. (Students could believe
that the suffix is -a, and that the final tone of any noun is low, hence the leniency in marking
diacritics.)
• Verbs with 2sg or 3pl subjects receive the prefixes j- and k- respectively, and the first two sounds
of the root swap places (metathesise).
