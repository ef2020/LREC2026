Problem 7. Korowai and Haruai (20 marks) 
Korowai is a Greater Awyu language spoken by about 
3,500 people in Indonesia. Haruai is a Madang 
language spoken by about 2,000 in Papua New Guinea. 
Despite the languages not being closely related, their 
numeral systems share many features. 
Below are some Korowai/Haruai phrases and their 
English translations (English-Korowai on the left, 
Haruai-English on the right).

Solution and marking. 
Scoring: (max 30) 
General principle:  
• Each answer has a structure which consists of one or more parts (separated as explained below).  
• Each part receives 1 point if it is completely correct. 
• In marking, match a candidate's complete answer onto the correct answer: 
o Make the best possible match by dividing it into parts to match the correct parts. 
o But if it includes correct forms in the wrong order, accept only those that have the right 
order relative to the items before them.   
▪ E.g. If correct = A B C, then A C B scores 1 for A, 1 for C (which correctly follows A), 
but 0 for B. 
o And if it includes extra forms (beyond the correct ones), include these in the parts before or 
after them which therefore are incorrect and score 0. 
▪ E.g. If correct = A B, then X A B scores 0 for X A, and A X B scores 0 for either A X or X 
B. 
Questions 
No half marks even if the answer is partly correct. 
• Q7.1: 1 point per part, where part = word or word-part (separated by +)     
 
[max 7] 
• Q7.2: 2 points per part = bracketed item.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
[max 8] 
• Q7.3: 1 point per phrase or number  
 
 
 
 
 
 
[max 15] 
o 0 points if it includes a number (e.g. 7 forearms) where the correct answer is just a noun 
(e.g. forearm)  
o For (e), accept "6, 18, 24 bracelets" – so long as it's clear that each number applies to 
bracelets. 
Q7.1 (a) senan                                    1 
Q7.3 (a) forearm                      1

*These words are not used attributively for 1 and 2. For Korowai, numbers in brackets represent the word 
with -anop marking.  
In Korowai, 26-X is then indicated by méN-X. To use a number as attributively, suffix -anop and place it 
after the noun. 
The Haruai system is slightly more complicated. It is optional whether you mark having moved to the other 
side of the body, and it is omitted in this question. Hence, for X≤5, X can also represent 18+X. For 6≤X≤11, X 
can also represent 24-X. There is no attributive marking. 
Note that when counting fingers on the second hand, Korowai counts in the opposite direction to the first 
hand (thumb > little finger), whereas Haruai counts the same direction (little finger > thumb). This is 
because when you count up in Korowai to higher numbers, the order reverses from finger> head, to head> 
finger, thus thumb> finger, but in Haruai it cycles back to the beginning with no change in order.
