Round 2 Problem 2. Proto-Algonquian 
Proto-Algonquian, like Proto-Indo-European, is an extinct language that has been reconstructed on 
the basis of its modern descendants. It is believed to have been spoken about 3000 years ago by the 
ancestors of the current speakers of the various Algonquian languages, which are spoken in Canada 
and the USA. In the data below, the ‘:’ indicates a long vowel, and the ‘θ’ indicates a ‘th’ sound, as in 
‘thing’.  
Here are some Proto-Algonquian words that can be translated as entire English sentences. (The data 
are somewhat simplified.)  
kewa:pameθehm   
I see you (singular). 
kewa:pameθehmwa:   
I see you (plural). 
newa:pama:ehma   
I see him/her. 
newa:pama:ehmaki   
I see them. 
kewa:pameθehmwa:ena:n   
We see you (plural). 
newa:pama:ehmena:na   
We see him/her. 
newa:pama:ehmena:naki   
We see them. 
kewa:pamiehm   
You (singular) see me. 
kewa:pama:ehm   
You (singular) see her/him. 
kewa:pamiehmwa:     
You (plural) see me. 
kewa:pamiehmwa:ena:n   
You (plural) see us.  
newa:pamekwehmena:naki   
They see us. 
 
Q.2.1. On your answer sheet, translate the following into the other language. 
a. kewa:pamiehmena:n     
b. We see them. 
c. They see me. 
Q.2.2. How does this bit of Proto-Algonquian grammar work? Use the table on the answer sheet to 
explain how each affix is used – i.e. its position within the word, and its contribution to the word’s 
meaning. If you introduce special conventions or notation for positions, don’t forget to explain them 
in the space provided.
